# ClientSim
## A VRChat Client Simulator for building Worlds

This tool enables you to test your VRChat SDK3 Worlds directly in Unity! You can look at the state of all objects to verify things directly.

## Features

- Debug everything in Unity.
- Inspect Udon variables in Play Mode.
- Desktop player controller.
- Grab Pickups, use Interacts, UI and Stations.
- Delete EditorOnly objects on Play.

### New Features in ClientSim
- Pickup manipulation through I, J, K, L, U, O, mouse scrolling and gamepad.
- Input based on keyboard layout isntead of specific keys.
- Local and Remote player now have humanoid avatars, avatar bones supported (but not full Avatar systems).
- View and set player data directly - Locomotion values, voice and avatar audio settings, combat health.
- Unlock mouse by holding tab - you can highlight off-center objects this way.
- Pointer displays when a UI element can be interacted with.
- New runtime options: start as non-master, invert mouse, show tooltips, change player scale, set target framerate, delay start to simulate loading.
- New playmode menu with updated style, player info and settings buttons.
- New buttons in the Settings Window to update Project Settings, no longer happens without user consent.
- Mesh highlighting that matches Android.
- Tooltip location updated to match client.
- Better gamepad support.
- Support for Disabled Domain Reload to enter playmode without delay - note that there is a Unity bug that causes UI Events to fail if they're not set to "Editor and Runtime".
- Automated Testing - you need to specifically enable this so it won't affect your project. Documentation forthcoming.

### Known Issues

- Manually changing Unity Project settings to enable the new input system may not properly allow input. Users should use the buttons in the ClientSim Settings Window.
- Physics.RaycastNonAlloc sometimes does not return colliders that have moved and do not have rigidbodies.
- On exiting playmode may throw exceptions occasionally due to order in which objects are destroyed.
- Highlight shader does not work on Mac (Metal).
